Summary



Python – Find Index or Position of Element in a List
To find index of the first occurrence of an element in a given Python List, you can use index() method of List class with the element passed as argument.
index = mylist.index(element)
The index() method returns an integer that represents the index of first match of specified element in the List.
You can also provide start and end positions of the List, where the search has to happen in the list.
Following is the syntax of index() function with start and end positions.

How do I print the content of a .txt file in Python?

I'm very new to programming (obviously) and really advanced computer stuff in general. I've only have basic computer knowledge, so I decided I wanted to learn more. Thus I'm teaching myself (through videos and ebooks) how to program.

Anyways, I'm working on a piece of code that will open a file, print out the contents on the screen, ask you if you want to edit/delete/etc the contents, do it, and then re-print out the results and ask you for confirmation to save.

I'm stuck at the printing the contents of the file. I don't know what command to use to do this. I've tried typing in several commands previously but here is the latest I've tried and no the code isn't complete:

from sys import argv

script, filename = argv
print "Who are you?"
name = raw_input()

print "What file are you looking for today?"
file = raw_input()

print (file)

print "Ok then, here's the file you wanted."

print "Would you like to delete the contents? Yes or No?"
I'm trying to write these practice codes to include as much as I've learned thus far. Also I'm working on Ubuntu 13.04 and Python 2.7.4 if that makes any difference. Thanks for any help thus far :)

Opening a file in python for reading is easy:

f = open('example.txt', 'r')
To get everything in the file, just use read()

file_contents = f.read()
And to print the contents, just do:

print (file_contents)
Don't forget to close the file when you're done.

f.close()

You should use the with clause, as others have mentioned in solutions below, as the context manager will take care of closing the file. –

Just do this:

>>> with open("path/to/file") as f: # The with keyword automatically closes the file when you are done
...     print f.read()
This will print the file in the terminal.

It seems in newer versions of Python it should be print(f.read()) –

with open("filename.txt", "w+") as file:
  for line in file:
    print line
This with statement automatically opens and closes it for you and you can iterate over the lines of the file with a simple for loop

to input a file:

fin = open(filename) #filename should be a string type: e.g filename = 'file.txt'
to output this file you can do:

for element in fin:
    print element
if the elements are a string you'd better add this before print:

element = element.strip()
strip() remove notations like this: /n

after opening a file, you can print everything by this as well: print fin –

How to read and print the content of a txt file
Assume you got a file called file.txt that you want to read in a program and the content is this:

this is the content of the file
with open you can read it and
then with a loop you can print it
on the screen. Using enconding='utf-8'
you avoid some strange convertions of
caracters. With strip(), you avoid printing
an empty line between each (not empty) line
You can read this content: write the following script in notepad:

with open("file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
save it as readfile.py for example, in the same folder of the txt file.

Then you run it (shift + right click of the mouse and select the prompt from the contextual menu) writing in the prompt:

C:\examples> python readfile.py

You should get this. Play attention to the word, they have to be written just as you see them and to the indentation. It is important in python. Use always the same indentation in each file (4 spaces are good).

output

this is the content of the file
with open you can read it and
then with a loop you can print it
on the screen. Using enconding='utf-8'
you avoid some strange convertions of
caracters. With strip(), you avoid printing
an empty line between each (not empty) line

This will give you the contents of a file separated, line-by-line in a list:

with open('xyz.txt') as f_obj:
    f_obj.readlines()

It's pretty simple

#Opening file
f= open('sample.txt')
#reading everything in file
r=f.read()
#reading at particular index
r=f.read(1)
#print
print(r)

Reading and printing the content of a text file (.txt) in Python3

Consider this as the content of text file with the name world.txt:

Hello World! This is an example of Content of the Text file we are about to read and print
using python!
First we will open this file by doing this:

file= open("world.txt", 'r')
Now we will get the content of file in a variable using .read() like this:

content_of_file= file.read()
Finally we will just print the content_of_file variable using print command.

print(content_of_file)
Output:

Hello World! This is an example of Content of the Text file we are about to read and print using python!

index = mylist.index(x, [start[,end]])
start parameter is optional. If you provide a value for start, then end is optional.

We shall look into examples, where we go through each of these scenarios in detail.

Python - Index or Position of Specific Element in a List
Example 1: Find Index of item in List
In the following example, we have taken a List with numbers. Using index() method we will find the index of item 8 in the list.

Python Program

mylist = [21, 5, 8, 52, 21, 87]
item = 8

#search for the item
index = mylist.index(item)

print('The index of', item, 'in the list is:', index)
 Run
Output

The index of 8 in the list is: 2
The element is present at 3rd position, so mylist.index() function returned 2.


Example 2: Find Index of Item in List – start, end
In the following example, we have taken a List with numbers. Using index() method we will find the index of item 8 in the list. Also, we shall pass start and end. index() function considers only those elements in the list starting from start index, till end position in mylist.

Python Program

mylist = [21, 8, 67, 52, 8, 21, 87]
item = 8
start=2
end=7

#search for the item
index = mylist.index(item, start, end)

print('The index of', item, 'in the list is:', index)
 Run
Output

The index of 8 in the list is: 4
Explanation

mylist = [21, 8, 67, 52, 8, 21, 87]
                 ----------------- only this part of the list is considered
                         ^ index finds the element here
          0   1   2   3  4 => 4 is returned by index()  
Example 3: Find Index of Item – Item has multiple occurrences in List
A Python List can contain multiple occurrences of an element. In such cases, only the index of first occurrence of specified element in the list is returned.

Python Program

mylist = [21, 5, 8, 52, 21, 87, 52]
item = 52

#search for the item
index = mylist.index(item)

print('The index of', item, 'in the list is:', index)
 Run
Output

The index of 52 in the list is: 3
The element 52 is present two times, but only the index of first occurrence is returned by index() method.

Let us understand how index() method works. The function scans the list from starting. When the item matches the argument, the function returns that index. The later occurrences are ignored.

Example 4: Find Index of Item in List – Item not present
If the element that we are searching in the List is not present, you will get a ValueError with the message item is not in list.

In the following program, we have taken a list and shall try to find the index of an element that is not present in the list.

Python Program

mylist = [21, 5, 8, 52, 21, 87, 52]
item = 67

#search for the item/element
index = mylist.index(item)

print('The index of', item, 'in the list is:', index)
 Run
Output

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 5, in <module>
    index = mylist.index(item)
ValueError: 67 is not in list
As index() can throw ValueError, use Python Try-Except while using index(). In the following example, we shall learn how to use try-except statement to handle this ValueError.

Python Program

mylist = [21, 5, 8, 52, 21, 87, 52]
item = 67

try:
	#search for the item
	index = mylist.index(item)
	print('The index of', item, 'in the list is:', index)
except ValueError:
	print('item not present')
 Run
Output

item not present
The item, whose index we are trying to find, is not present in the list. Therefore, mylist.index(item) throws ValueError. except ValueError: block catches this Error and the corresponding block is executed.

Summary
In this Python Tutorial, we learned how to find the index of an element/item in a list, with the help of well detailed examples.
